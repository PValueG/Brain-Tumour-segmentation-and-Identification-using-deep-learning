# Brain-Tumour-Segmentation-and-identification
This code must be ran on google colab unless you make the appropriate edits to make it local
The dataset must be uploaded to Google Colab, but you can alter the file path to which ever you want
the .ipynb file is what should be used for colab, the .py file is availble for ease of viewing the code but should not be used to run the artefact unless the appropriate changes have been made that are included in the code comments on the appropriate lines 
Dataset is availble on https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2019/registration.html
